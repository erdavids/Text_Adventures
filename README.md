#(WIP) Text Based Adventure Game (yet to be named)

This will be my third text based adventure game, after one I can barely remember, and one based on Utopia by Thomas More

I have always been attracted to simpler games with greater reliance on imagination to fully immerse oneself into the world.
I personally find great joy in playing old roguelikes and text adventure games, so I would like to eventually be able to publish one!

I hope to add a myriad of features using my knowledge of Java, including...
+ Quests
+ Randomized Weapons/Loot
+ Low-level Enemy AI
+ Leveling System
+ Interactive Dialogue 

This game will be implemented with a mixture of object-centric and property-centric design.
